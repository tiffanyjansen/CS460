        <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
        <p>
            When first looking at the assigment I was really scared it was going to take a super long 
            time, but once I got started everything kind of started falling into place. The assignment 
            asked us to create a simple webpage using Git, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap-4. At first I didn't think
            I knew anything about any of it, but once I started looking I realized I had used HTML and CSS 
            a little over the summer when I was trying to prepare myself for this class (I guess it kind of 
            worked...). The parts that confused me the most were the Git and Bootstrap-4 parts just because 
            I hadn't really heard of them and I didn't really understand what they did. Lucky for me I have
            lots of friends in the class and one of them was kind enough to explain how to get Git set up once 
            I had it downloaded. Once I got that going it seemed pretty easy because the rest of the assignment used 
            HTML and CSS and I knew the basics of those. Another issue I had was with Bootstrap-4 becuase I didn't realize 
            it needed to be added to the repository (the place where all the code is), but once I got that done the rest fell
            into place easily. There is a lot of documentation for Bootstrap making it super easy to learn in a short
            amount of time.

                    <h3>Step 1: Download Git and Create a GitHub</h3>
                    <p>
                        I downloaded git before I made my GitHub, but I didn't do anything with it since, at the time, I didn't 
                        really know what to do with it. I made my GitHub and made a repository on the site because when I was looking 
                        at the examples that Dr. Morse gave us, they all said that was the easiest way to get the stuff set up. Once I did 
                        that I cloned it by opening up the Git Bash I had downloaded when I downloaded Git (seen to the right). After cloning 
                        it I moved my directory so I was in the folder. Then I checked the status because that's what I was told to do. Then I 
                        was done with this step! Woo!!

                    <h3>Step 2: Plan the Webpage</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I first started this project I had no idea what I was going to do, so I drew some pictures and 
                        tried to turn those into a "reality." The sketches are really bad, so don't judge, but they are on the left and below. 
                        I miss my cats from home and my new apartment won't let me have one so I decided to do my website about cats. 
                        I decided on the random stuff I did because of all the requirements, but I used Bootstrap-4 on every page whether
                        the page was one column or 2. I tried doing a 3-column page, but all the pictures I found were too big and it looked 
                        kind of stupid, so I just stuck to the 2 column one. Since I already knew a lot of HTML and CSS the rest wasn't too hard 
                        once I had a plan. I ended up looking up some stuff, but I already knew most of it. The link for the webpage I created 
                        can be found <a href="page1.html">here</a>. The page is cute and everything but it's no where near perfect. If I could I 
                        would keep working on it forever, but of course I can't because I have 4 other classes and the next assigment in this class 
                        is due in a little over a week, so I should just stop while I am ahead. Anyway, this was the plan.

                        <p>
                            The next step was to build the site. At first it didn't seem to like me, but once I got into the groove of things 
                            it actually went really smoothly. When I first started I thought I had to commit to see any changes so that's why 
                            I have a ton of commits when I first started my site.
