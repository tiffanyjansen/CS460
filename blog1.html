        <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
        <p>
            When first looking at the assigment I was really scared it was going to take a super long 
            time, but once I got started everything kind of started falling into place. The assignment 
            asked us to create a simple webpage using Git, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap-4. At first I didn't think
            I knew anything about any of it, but once I started looking I realized I had used HTML and CSS 
            a little over the summer when I was trying to prepare myself for this class (I guess it kind of 
            worked...). The parts that confused me the most were the Git and Bootstrap-4 parts just because 
            I hadn't really heard of them and I didn't really understand what they did. Lucky for me I have
            lots of friends in the class and one of them was kind enough to explain how to get Git set up once 
            I had it downloaded. Once I got that going it seemed pretty easy because the rest of the assignment used 
            HTML and CSS and I knew the basics of those. Another issue I had was with Bootstrap-4 becuase I didn't realize 
            it needed to be added to the repository (the place where all the code is), but once I got that done the rest fell
            into place easily. There is a lot of documentation for Bootstrap making it super easy to learn in a short
            amount of time.

                    <h3>Step 1: Download Git and Create a GitHub</h3>
                    <p>
                        I downloaded git before I made my GitHub, but I didn't do anything with it since, at the time, I didn't 
                        really know what to do with it. I made my GitHub and made a repository on the site because when I was looking 
                        at the examples that Dr. Morse gave us, they all said that was the easiest way to get the stuff set up. Once I did 
                        that I cloned it by opening up the Git Bash I had downloaded when I downloaded Git (seen to the right). After cloning 
                        it I moved my directory so I was in the folder. Then I checked the status because that's what I was told to do. Then I 
                        was done with this step! Woo!!
