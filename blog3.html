                        This assignment was assigned to get us comfortable with JavaScript.

                    <h3>Step 2: Get Java Code Downloaded and Tested</h3>
                    <p>
                        I downloaded the Java code from the link on the HW3 page. I then got
                        my command line to be able to compile and run the Java code, which took
                        a while because I haven't used Java for a few years and I guess I screwed
                        up my Command Prompt stuff. Once I got that working, I ran the code with an 
                        example so I could see what the output should look like.

                    <h3>Step 3: Turn it into C# Code</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the part that took the longest. The code itself wasn't too bad because Java is very
                        similar to C#, but I had to remember to capitalize anything that was required to be capital according
                        to C# conventions, and some of the other stuff was different than Java. For example, the Exception stuff.
                        The Java code used super() and C# uses base() instead, they also use it in a very different way. (Seen to the right).
                        This was the entire QueueUnderflowException class for each of the types. I was confused by some of the other differences 
                        between Java and C#, like the "for each" loop (Shown Directly Below). It was different enough that I had to Google the 
                        information about it to make sure that I did it the right way. The default() method threw me off too. In Java it's
                        unneccesary, but when using C# it will give an error since we aren't sure what type of variable the "T" variable is. 
                        At first I thought I had to use the default method everywhere, but then I realized it was only in 1 specific spot that it
                        was required. Other than that I found C# to be very similar to Java which made translating the application super simple. :)

                        This is where I just made sure the output for the C# code was the same as the Java code.
                        It was really fun to do, once I figured out all of the C# stuff. Honestly, it wasn't too hard of an assignment.

                    <p>
                        This assignment was really fun because I got to incorporate math into it.
                        I know that I probably went WAY overboard on the assignment, but I couldn't 
                        back down once I told my friends in the class about it. I am super glad that I 
                        set aside 3 whole days to work on it, if I hadn't there is no way I would be done
                        with it. I honestly feel like I will be ready to keep going in this class.
