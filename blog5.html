        <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
        <p>
            This assignment was designed to get us more familiar with the MVC Framework and ASP.NET. It also started to introduce
            how to add a database to a project in order to make it do something. This project was difficult. We had just started using Visual
            Studio and then we added a Database and model... The entire thing was very mind-blowing. But I got through it. I will try to explain
            everything well enough here, but if I get too frustrated I will create a video for it on Monday/Tuesday to Demo it better. 
            **Today is Friday and I'm on a flight to Michigan for a Conference so I cannot do a video this weekend, otherwise I would.**

                <h3>Step 1: Create a Home Page</h3>
                <p>
                    This part was fun. I started with the MVC project so it used a lot of Bootstrap formatting stuff, but, unlike the last one,
                    I decided to do something different. In the example on his HW5 page he used "Campus Apartments" and since I'm so uncreative I 
                    just copied his name. When I think of campus I think of Western and Western is Red and Black, so instead of all the blue and grey
                    formatting that Bootstrap has I created my own red and black one. I don't know if it's super nice looking, but I think it looks 
                    okay. If I had more time to work on it I would probably change a few more things, but I don't so it's going to have to stay the way it is.
                    I enjoy using HTML and  since the home page is just a normal view the code was all CSS and HTML which everyone already knows, so I will just
                    add a picture of what it looks like below, so you can see my design.

                <h3>Step 2: Create the Database</h3>
                <p>
                    This wasn't the hardest part of the assignment, but it was kind of difficult compared to just creatinng the home page. 
                    In class we were shown how to do the Model first and then connect a database to that, but on the homework it said the opposite.
                    So I knew how to do steps 3 and 4 before I knew how to do step 2. Once I finally got the thing created and connected correctly the 
                    rest wasn't so bad. Creating it was harder than expected though because you can't just "Add Table" you have to write it all in a query
                    and make sure it works before you can even move on. I had a lot of errors because I haven't used SQL in a while and I wasn't sure what
                    I was doing. Once he explained it in class everything made sense, but of course I had to work on it before Wednesday so I was hitting my 
                    head against a wall from Sunday to Wednesday, but that's totally fine. The SQL code to create and drop the table can be found below the picture 
                    of the home page.

        <p>
            This project was frustrating. I knew I wasn't going to have any time this weekend to do stuff so I tried to get ahead, but then 
            we didn't learn half the stuff until the Thursday in class so I had no idea what I was doing. Lucky for me I had a lot of it done and
            just did some Googling for the stuff I didn't understand. I think I'm really going to enjoy the next few assignments now that I kind of
            understand what is going on when it comes to adding Databases to MVC Projects.
