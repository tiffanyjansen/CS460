        <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
        <p>
            This assignment was designed to get us more familiar with the MVC Framework and ASP.NET. It also started to introduce
            how to add a database to a project in order to make it do something. This project was difficult. We had just started using Visual
            Studio and then we added a Database and model... The entire thing was very mind-blowing. But I got through it. I will try to explain
            everything well enough here, but if I get too frustrated I will create a video for it on Monday/Tuesday to Demo it better. 
            **Today is Friday and I'm on a flight to Michigan for a Conference so I cannot do a video this weekend, otherwise I would.**

        <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
        <p>
            This project was frustrating. I knew I wasn't going to have any time this weekend to do stuff so I tried to get ahead, but then 
            we didn't learn half the stuff until the Thursday in class so I had no idea what I was doing. Lucky for me I had a lot of it done and
            just did some Googling for the stuff I didn't understand. I think I'm really going to enjoy the next few assignments now that I kind of
            understand what is going on when it comes to adding Databases to MVC Projects.
