                <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
                <p>
                    This assignment was assigned to get us back into using Javascript and JQuery and learn 
                    some AJAX and how to use JSON. We also learned how to hide API Keys and use the GIPHY API.
                    I thought this assignment was super fun. I was kind of worried it was going to take forever,
                    but it wasn't so bad because I had a lot more time this week to get help from my friends in the 
                    class.

                <p>
                    This was the easy step. I just selected Empty and checked the MVC box.

                <h3>Step 2: Make Page</h3>
                <p>
                    This part was fun, I really enjoy formatting stuff (most of the time) so creating
                    pages is always fun for me. Below is what the homepage looks like before people start
                    typing things. The picture on the homework assignment page didn't have any color, but I 
                    don't like Black and White things, so I decided to add some blue and make it look nice. 
                    (I always waste a lot of time doing formatting/CSS stuff...)

                    When I was first doing the text box I was having issues making it go across the screen
                    until someone mentioned that the CSS that comes with the projects has a limit on how big 
                    those things can be. This part was fun after I got that fixed.

                <h3>Step 3: Get GIPHY key and hide it</h3>
                <p>
                    This step was very straight forward. You go to the GIPHY site, say you want to 
                    use their stuff for a project and then they give you a "key." This way they can track 
                    what you do with their stuff. We were shown in class the way to hide the key because 
                    we are supposed to treat it like a password. I will make sure to include screenshots 
                    of the stuff that I did, but block out the key so no one else can use it. 
                    1. Create a AppSettings Secrets file. 
                </p>

                    2. Put file outside of GIT Repository Files. <br>
                    The CS460 folder is my Git Repository. The highlighted file is the file with my Giphy Key 
                    in it.

                <p>
                    3. Add the file to the Web.config file.

                <h3>Step 4: Javascript File for User Input</h3>
                <p>
                   We were asked to use Javascript to parse what the user is inputting into our text box. 
                   We had to check for a space being pressed instead of an enter key. The code for my solution 
                   is here:

                    $("#words").keypress(function (e) {<br>
                    var word = "";<br>
                    
                    if (e.keyCode == 0 || e.keyCode == 32) {<br>
                        console.log("space");<br>
                        var value = $("#words").val().toString();<br>
                        var listWords = value.split(' ');<br>
                        word = listWords[listWords.length - 1];<br>

                <h3>Step 5: Decide if a word is "boring" or not</h3>
                <p>
                    This part was not too bad. I found a list of nouns and verbs that were already in 
                    Javascript format so I just used those (Named nouns and verbs) and decided those would 
                    be considered "interesting." Otherwise, the word is "boring." The code for the implementation 
                    of what happens if a word is interesting can be found here: 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Code">
                <h4>sentenceCreator.js (cont)</h4>
                <p>
                    if (nouns.includes(word.toLowerCase()) || verbs.includes(word.toLowerCase())) { <br>
                        var source = "/API/Sentence/" + word;<br>
                        console.log(source);<br>
                        <br>
                         $.ajax({<br>
                            type: "GET",<br>
                            dataType: "json",<br>
                            url: source,<br>
                            success: successAjax,<br>
                            error: errorAjax<br>
                        });<br>
                    }<br>
                    else {<br>
                        var string = word + " ";<br>
                        $("#Sentence h2").append(string);<br>
                    }<br>
                </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Step 5 (Cont.)</h3>
                <p>
                    The if statement decides if the word is interesting. If it is it continues in the if 
                    statement. The sourse is my custom route that can be found in my RoutConfig file (found below). 
                    The ajax part is what we were asked to use in order to get the JSON object from GIPHY. The rest of the 
                    code for that is in my API controller. If the word is not interesting 
                    the else statement gets run and the word just gets appended to the div I'm using to hold the sentence on 
                    the page. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Code">
                <h4>RouteConfig.cs</h4>
                <p>
                    routes.MapRoute(<br>
                        name: "Default",<br>
                        url: "{controller}/{action}",<br>
                        defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index"}<br>
                    );<br>
            
                    routes.MapRoute(<br>
                        name: "API",<br>
                        url: "{controller}/{action}/{word}",<br>
                        defaults: new {controller = "API", action = "Sentence"}<br>
                    );<br>

            </div>
            <div id="Words">
                <p>
                    Once I decided if the word was interesting it was sent to my controller. 
                    The next step is getting the Controller to return the JSON object from GIPHY 
                    and access the url to get the GIF onto the page.

                <h3>Step 6: Use C# to Access GIPHY's JSON Object</h3>
                <p>
                    Since we were required to use C# I figured the Controller would be the best place to put 
                    the code for this. Since I couldn't find any other way someone (Stacia) told me to use 
                    a NuGet called "Newtonsoft JSon." This made accessing the Json object from GIPHY much easier. 
                    The code for accessing this object sending it back can be found below (ignore the AddToDatabase function, 
                    I will talk about it later.)
                    <br><br>
                    The first line on the right is how I access the key that I put in the App Secrets
                    file. This part was fine because I had my file correct in the WebConfig file. The 
                    Debug.WriteLines were for testing. The website is the site we need to go to to get the 
                    Json object from GIPHY. Next we want to read what GIPHY has responded with and put it into 
                    a string that we can parse through to find the GIF for our page. After that we use the 
                    JObject.Parse method to turn this string into our Json object. (This was from the NuGet 
                    we installed.) After that we can just access it like we normally would. The webiste we want 
                    is in the embed_url which is in the data so that's why we have the double thing happening there.
                    After that we return it back to our Ajax method where it decides if we succefully did that or not.

                    This part wasn't too bad since I already had the information I needed from the Controller.
                    In the Javascript file I had to create an iframe object from HTML and add the information from

                <p>
                    Creating the database wasn't too bad, adding the data to it was the hard part (for me anyway).
                    Creating the database was the same as we've done in previous homeworks, I even created a context class 
                    using the tools from Homework 6 to make the model class for me. Once I got that done I made the 
                    "AddToDatabase" function that I said I was going to explain later (it's officially later now). The creating 
                    of the database wass explained in Blog 6 and Blog 5 (maybe 4?) so I'm not going to do that again.
                    Instead I will solely focus on how I got the information into the Database in the "AddToDatabase" function.

                <p>
                    As you can see I did a lot of debugging while I was creating the project, but testing out 
                    the completed work is the best part. In order to see if it's all working I'm going to include 
                    some screenshots here and a link to a Demo video so you can see it more in action. The screenshots 
                    are mainly to see if the Database is actually working or not.

                <p>
                    This was a fun assignment. I wanted to throw my laptop at the wall a couple of times because of 
                    stupid mistakes that I couldn't figure out what went wrong, but other than that the assignment wassn't 
                    too bad. This was definitely one of the shorter assignments that we have had... (Thank Goodness!)
