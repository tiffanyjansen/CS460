        <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
        <p>
            This assignment was designed to get as more familiar with databases in ASP.NET. I had some issues with connecting the database and 
            some of the queries. It was fun figuring out everything tho.

                <h3>Step 1: Connect the Database and Create Model Classes</h3>
                <p>
                    This step was difficult because I had problems downloading the materials for it. Once I got everything downloaded and working, it 
                    all worked out. It wasn't too hard one I got the SSMS working and everything. I ended up creating the WWIContext and creating
                    models automatically once I got the database connected. That part wasn't too bad because it was shown in class and you just have to 
                    select the right thing when creating the class. Then I had to move that into the DAL folder so it's where it belongs.

                <h3>Step 2: Get the Information For Each person</h3>
                <p>
                    We were asked to get the Full Name, Preferred Name, Phone Number, Fax Number, Email address, the date they became a 
                    customer, member or employee, and photo for each person. This wasn't too bad, but I had to keep in mind that we were
                    going to have to add more later, so I created a ViewModel for all the information. The ViewModel looks like:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Code">
                <h4>Info.cs</h4>
                <p>   
                    public class Info <br>
                    {<br>
                    
                        public Info() { }<br>
                        public Info(string Name, string PName, string Phone, string Fax, string Email, DateTime Member)<br>
                        {<br>
                            this.Name = Name;<br>
                            this.PName = PName;<br>
                            this.Phone = Phone;<br>
                            this.Fax = Fax;<br>
                            this.Email = Email;<br>

                        }<br>
                    
                        //Part 1 of Assignment<br>
                        //Person Information<br>
                        [Key]<br>
                        public string Name { get; set; }<br>
                    
                        [Display(Name="Preferred Name")]<br>
                        public string PName { get; set; }<br>
                        [Display(Name="Phone Number")]<br>
                        public string Phone { get; set; }<br>
                        [Display(Name="Fax Number")]<br>
                        public string Fax { get; set; }<br>
                        [Display(Name="Email Address")]<br>
                        public string Email { get; set; }<br>
                        [Display(Name="Member Since")]<br>
                        [DisplayFormat(DataFormatString = "{0:MM/yyyy}")]<br>
                        public DateTime Member { get; set; }<br>
                    }
                </p> 
            </div>
            <div id="Words">
                <p>
                    The second part was making the search page so people can search for the client they are looking for. I had to make the 
                    buttons do something and have the output show multiple buttons. In order to do this I had to use:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Code">
                <h4>Search.cshtml</h4>
                <p>
                    Button Code:<br>
                    class="btn-group-justified, btn-block" type="submit" style="text-align: left; color: black; padding: 10px; margin-top: 5px; opacity: 0.65;" name="ID" value=@item.PersonID>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.FullName)<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>HomeController.cs</h4>
                <p>
                    How to get the people for the buttons. <br>
                    [HttpGet]<br>
                    public ActionResult Search()<br>
                    {<br>
                        string SearchString = Request.QueryString["search"];<br>
                    
                        var Results = db.People.Where(p => p.SearchName.Contains(SearchString));<br>
                
                        return View(Results);<br>
                    }<br>
                </p>
            </div>                
            <div id="Words">
                <p>
                    The third part was creating the Queries to get the information into the View. For this part I
                    used LinqPad to make sure the query did what I wanted and then I added it to the Controller that was used. This is what I
                    used to query the information once the client selects the button to go to the page for the person.

                    .Select(p => new { Name = p.FullName, PName = p.PreferredName, Phone = p.PhoneNumber, Fax = p.FaxNumber, Email = p.EmailAddress, Member = p.ValidFrom })<br>
                    .First();<br>

                    Info Result = new Info<br>

                <p>
                    We were asked to get: <br>
                    For the company: Company name, Phone number, Fax number, Website (as a link), and Year they started as our customer. <br>
                    For the purchases: The Number of Orders Made, Total Gross Sales, and Total Gross Profits <br>
                    For the rest: The Tep 10 most profitable items with the StockItemID, Description, Profit and the Salesperson who handled the sale.<br>
                    I had to add a bunch of stuff to my Info ViewModel. The stuff I added can be found below.

                    Next I had to figure out how to get the information I needed from the tables. For this i wrote out 4 different queries
                    because all the information was kind of difficult to find. The queries were super fun to write and I have included them below. 
                    I also included how I got the information into the Info object I created from the first part.

                    After that I just had to make it look nice in the View, which was mostly just styling stuff. I would include the code, but the 
                    important part is the queries and I don't feel like copying and pasting MORE code into this.

        <p>
            This project was something. I spent all weekend working on it and I didn't have a lot of time this week because of work. I was impressed
            with how easily I figured out some of the logic in the assignment. I think it helps that I'm really into math and yeah. I really enjoyed
            this assignment but it was a LOT of work.
