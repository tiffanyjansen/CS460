        <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
        <p>
            This assignment was designed to get as more familiar with databases in ASP.NET. I had some issues with connecting the database and 
            some of the queries. It was fun figuring out everything tho.

                <h3>Step 1: Connect the Database and Create Model Classes</h3>
                <p>
                    This step was difficult because I had problems downloading the materials for it. Once I got everything downloaded and working, it 
                    all worked out. It wasn't too hard one I got the SSMS working and everything. I ended up creating the WWIContext and creating
                    models automatically once I got the database connected. That part wasn't too bad because it was shown in class and you just have to 
                    select the right thing when creating the class. Then I had to move that into the DAL folder so it's where it belongs.

                <h3>Step 2: Get the Information For Each person</h3>
                <p>
                    We were asked to get the Full Name, Preferred Name, Phone Number, Fax Number, Email address, the date they became a 
                    customer, member or employee, and photo for each person. This wasn't too bad, but I had to keep in mind that we were
                    going to have to add more later, so I created a ViewModel for all the information. The ViewModel looks like:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Code">
                <h4>Info.cs</h4>
                <p>   
                    public class Info <br>
                    {<br>
                    
                        public Info() { }<br>
                        public Info(string Name, string PName, string Phone, string Fax, string Email, DateTime Member)<br>
                        {<br>
                            this.Name = Name;<br>
                            this.PName = PName;<br>
                            this.Phone = Phone;<br>
                            this.Fax = Fax;<br>
                            this.Email = Email;<br>
                            this.Member = Member;<br>
                        }<br>
                    
                        //Part 1 of Assignment<br>
                        //Person Information<br>
                        [Key]<br>
                        public string Name { get; set; }<br>
                    
                        [Display(Name="Preferred Name")]<br>
                        public string PName { get; set; }<br>
                        [Display(Name="Phone Number")]<br>
                        public string Phone { get; set; }<br>
                        [Display(Name="Fax Number")]<br>
                        public string Fax { get; set; }<br>
                        [Display(Name="Email Address")]<br>
                        public string Email { get; set; }<br>
                        [Display(Name="Member Since")]<br>
                        [DisplayFormat(DataFormatString = "{0:MM/yyyy}")]<br>
                        public DateTime Member { get; set; }<br>
                    }
                </p> 
            </div>
            <div id="Words">
                <p>
                    The second part was making the search page so people can search for the client they are looking for. I had to make the 
                    buttons do something and have the output show multiple buttons. In order to do this I had to use:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Code">
                <h4>Search.cshtml</h4>
                <p>
                    Button Code:<br>
                    class="btn-group-justified, btn-block" type="submit" style="text-align: left; color: black; padding: 10px; margin-top: 5px; opacity: 0.65;" name="ID" value=@item.PersonID>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.FullName)<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>HomeController.cs</h4>
                <p>
                    How to get the people for the buttons. <br>
                    [HttpGet]<br>
                    public ActionResult Search()<br>
                    {<br>
                        string SearchString = Request.QueryString["search"];<br>
                    
                        var Results = db.People.Where(p => p.SearchName.Contains(SearchString));<br>
                
                        return View(Results);<br>
                    }<br>
                </p>
            </div>                
            <div id="Words">
                <p>
                    The third part was creating the Queries to get the information into the View. For this part I
                    used LinqPad to make sure the query did what I wanted and then I added it to the Controller that was used. This is what I
                    used to query the information once the client selects the button to go to the page for the person. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Code">
                <h4>HomeController.cs</h4>
                <p>
                    var Person = db.People <br>
                    .Where(p => p.PersonID == ID)<br>
                    .Select(p => new { Name = p.FullName, PName = p.PreferredName, Phone = p.PhoneNumber, Fax = p.FaxNumber, Email = p.EmailAddress, Member = p.ValidFrom })<br>
                    .First();<br>
        
                    Info Result = new Info<br>
                    {<br>
                        Name = Person.Name,<br>
                        PName = Person.PName,<br>
                        Phone = Person.Phone,<br>
                        Fax = Person.Fax,<br>
                        Email = Person.Email,<br>
                        Member = Person.Member<br>
                    };<br>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

        <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
        <p>
            This project was something. I spent all weekend working on it and I didn't have a lot of time this week because of work. I was impressed
            with how easily I figured out some of the logic in the assignment. I think it helps that I'm really into math and yeah. I really enjoyed
            this assignment but it was a LOT of work.
