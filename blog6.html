        <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
        <p>
            This assignment was designed to get as more familiar with databases in ASP.NET. I had some issues with connecting the database and 
            some of the queries. It was fun figuring out everything tho.

                <h3>Step 1: Connect the Database and Create Model Classes</h3>
                <p>
                    This step was difficult because I had problems downloading the materials for it. Once I got everything downloaded and working, it 
                    all worked out. It wasn't too hard one I got the SSMS working and everything. I ended up creating the WWIContext and creating
                    models automatically once I got the database connected. That part wasn't too bad because it was shown in class and you just have to 
                    select the right thing when creating the class. Then I had to move that into the DAL folder so it's where it belongs.

        <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
        <p>
            This project was something. I spent all weekend working on it and I didn't have a lot of time this week because of work. I was impressed
            with how easily I figured out some of the logic in the assignment. I think it helps that I'm really into math and yeah. I really enjoyed
            this assignment but it was a LOT of work.
