                    <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
                    <p>
                        This assignment was assigned to get us comfortable with ASP.NET MVC. The basics of it.
                        We were expected to recreate a webpage using certain things, like HttpPost and HttpGet 
                        things in a specific way. I will explain more about the requirements as I go through this blog.

                    <h3>Step 1: Create a new MVC Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        This part wasn't too bad. We just had to create a new project on 
                        Visual Studio and make sure it was an MVC project with ASP.NET Framework. 
                        I would show the screenshots of doing this, but that seems kind of stupid, so 
                        we will just stick to the other stuff.

                    <h3>Step 2: Implement the Home Page</h3>
                    <p>
                        We had to use branches in git, so I made a branch named converter and used
                        that for all of my implementation of the Mile Converter and most of the Home Page.
                        I wasn't really sure what to do at first, but once I got into it, everything made more sense.
                        The Controller does the work and the View shows the page. Controller = C#. View = HTML.
                                        
                        <br><br>
                
                        Since we used the MVC template for the project all I had to do for the home page was edit the text and fix
                        the buttons. The links for the buttons looked like: "@Html.ActionLink("Try it Out", "Converter", "Home")"
                        Where "Try it Out" is the text shown on the button, "Converter" is the View/Method we want, and "Home" is the 
                        Controller we are using. (I only put that in here so I remember later).
                
                        <br><br>
                
                        I also had to go into the _Layout.cshtml in order to fix the Nav Bar, where I used the same links to get
                        from page to page.

                    <h3>Step 3: Implement the Mile Converter</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first thing I did for the Mile Converter was create the form. This part wasn't too bad until I had to 
                        actually make the form do something. Last week we used Javascript to make it work, but this week we were not allowed
                        to. I ended up looking up how to make the form do something. According to the internet I needed something like: 
                        'form method="get"' to make the form do something. We were expected to use the HttpGet function to make it work. I implemented
                        this part in my Converter() function in the HomeController. The Code can be found below. Basically what it does is use the 
                        Query Strings and decide which value to use. The code can be found below. I also have included screenshots with the what it does.
                        I did not include a handler if someone adds a letter to the query string for miles, but I did handle the error for if someone were 
                        to change the units one.    
                        
                        <br><br> 
                        
                        Now, if someone puts a number into the box and chooses a unit the page will work perfectly fine. If the person does 
                        not put in anything into the miles the page will work, but the output will not exist. If someone goes and changes something in the query
                        string at the top, as long as they don't put a letter into the miles one, the page will work. Examples of all 3 can be found below (in order).
                        I have also included the page in general (which will be the first one) so you know what it's supposed to look like when it first loads.

                    <p>
                        So, I created branches (2) and used them, but I guess I forgot
                        to advance Master so the "colorChooser" branch (the one I merged first) 
                        didn't end up showing up so it looks like I just used one branch, but I swear I 
                        didn't. It was intresting to see how the merge conflict showed up because it just 
                        said it couldn't add whatever file it was because of the conflict, when I looked in the file 
                        it just had random lines in places and I got to choose which one to keep. I was impressed.

                    <p>
                        This assignment was fun. It took a little longer than the last one because ASP.NET MVC was
                        something entirely new to me and I worked a lot more this week than last week, but it was good.
                        I definitely feel more comfortable with the MVC framework. I'm sure it'll just keep getting more
                        and more complicated as the weeks go on, but it'll all be okay.
