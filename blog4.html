                    <p>
                        This assignment was assigned to get us comfortable with ASP.NET MVC. The basics of it.
                        We were expected to recreate a webpage using certain things, like HttpPost and HttpGet 
                        things in a specific way. I will explain more about the requirements as I go through this blog.

                        This assignment was fun. It took a little longer than the last one because ASP.NET MVC was
                        something entirely new to me and I worked a lot more this week than last week, but it was good.
                        I definitely feel more comfortable with the MVC framework. I'm sure it'll just keep getting more
                        and more complicated as the weeks go on, but it'll all be okay.
