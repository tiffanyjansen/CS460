                    <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
                    <p>
                        This assignment was assigned to get us comfortable with ASP.NET MVC. The basics of it.
                        We were expected to recreate a webpage using certain things, like HttpPost and HttpGet 
                        things in a specific way. I will explain more about the requirements as I go through this blog.

                    <h3>Step 1: Create a new MVC Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        This part wasn't too bad. We just had to create a new project on 
                        Visual Studio and make sure it was an MVC project with ASP.NET Framework. 
                        I would show the screenshots of doing this, but that seems kind of stupid, so 
                        we will just stick to the other stuff.

                    <h3>Step 2: Implement the Home Page</h3>
                    <p>
                        We had to use branches in git, so I made a branch named converter and used
                        that for all of my implementation of the Mile Converter and most of the Home Page.
                        I wasn't really sure what to do at first, but once I got into it, everything made more sense.
                        The Controller does the work and the View shows the page. Controller = C#. View = HTML.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        Since we used the MVC template for the project all I had to do for the home page was edit the text and fix
                        the buttons. The links for the buttons looked like: "@Html.ActionLink("Try it Out", "Converter", "Home")"
                        Where "Try it Out" is the text shown on the button, "Converter" is the View/Method we want, and "Home" is the 
                        Controller we are using. (I only put that in here so I remember later).

                        <br><br>

                        I also had to go into the _Layout.cshtml in order to fix the Nav Bar, where I used the same links to get
                        from page to page.

                            <p>
                                So, I created branches (2) and used them, but I guess I forgot
                                to advance Master so the "colorChooser" branch (the one I merged first) 
                                didn't end up showing up so it looks like I just used one branch, but I swear I 
                                didn't. It was intresting to see how the merge conflict showed up because it just 
                                said it couldn't add whatever file it was because of the conflict, when I looked in the file 
                                it just had random lines in places and I got to choose which one to keep. I was impressed.

                    <p>
                        This assignment was fun. It took a little longer than the last one because ASP.NET MVC was
                        something entirely new to me and I worked a lot more this week than last week, but it was good.
                        I definitely feel more comfortable with the MVC framework. I'm sure it'll just keep getting more
                        and more complicated as the weeks go on, but it'll all be okay.
