                    <p>
                        This assignment was assigned to get us comfortable with ASP.NET MVC. The basics of it.
                        We were expected to recreate a webpage using certain things, like HttpPost and HttpGet 
                        things in a specific way. I will explain more about the requirements as I go through this blog.

                    <h3>Step 1: Create a new MVC Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        This part wasn't too bad. We just had to create a new project on 
                        Visual Studio and make sure it was an MVC project with ASP.NET Framework. 
                        I would show the screenshots of doing this, but that seems kind of stupid, so 
                        we will just stick to the other stuff.

                    <h3>Step 2: Implement the Home Page</h3>
                    <p>
                        We had to use branches in git, so I made a branch named converter and used
                        that for all of my implementation of the Mile Converter and most of the Home Page.
                        I wasn't really sure what to do at first, but once I got into it, everything made more sense.
                        The Controller does the work and the View shows the page. Controller = C#. View = HTML.
                                        
                        <br><br>
                
                        Since we used the MVC template for the project all I had to do for the home page was edit the text and fix
                        the buttons. The links for the buttons looked like: "@Html.ActionLink("Try it Out", "Converter", "Home")"
                        Where "Try it Out" is the text shown on the button, "Converter" is the View/Method we want, and "Home" is the 
                        Controller we are using. (I only put that in here so I remember later).
                
                        <br><br>
                
                        I also had to go into the _Layout.cshtml in order to fix the Nav Bar, where I used the same links to get
                        from page to page.

                    <h3>Step 3: Implement the Mile Converter</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first thing I did for the Mile Converter was create the form. This part wasn't too bad until I had to 
                        actually make the form do something. Last week we used Javascript to make it work, but this week we were not allowed
                        to. I ended up looking up how to make the form do something. According to the internet I needed something like: 
                        'form method="get"' to make the form do something. We were expected to use the HttpGet function to make it work. I implemented
                        this part in my Converter() function in the HomeController. The Code can be found below. Basically what it does is use the 
                        Query Strings and decide which value to use. The code can be found below. I also have included screenshots with the what it does.
                        I did not include a handler if someone adds a letter to the query string for miles, but I did handle the error for if someone were 
                        to change the units one.    
                        
                        <br><br> 
                        
                        Now, if someone puts a number into the box and chooses a unit the page will work perfectly fine. If the person does 
                        not put in anything into the miles the page will work, but the output will not exist. If someone goes and changes something in the query
                        string at the top, as long as they don't put a letter into the miles one, the page will work. Examples of all 3 can be found below (in order).
                        I have also included the page in general (which will be the first one) so you know what it's supposed to look like when it first loads.

                    <h3>Step 4: Implement the Color Chooser</h3>
                    <p>
                        This one was a little more complicated than the Mile Converter. We were asked to use HttpPost instead of HttpGet
                        this time and we were asked to use Razor shortcuts to create our form. The code for the form wasn't too hard to find around.
                        I did get some help from my Byte Club buddies for some of it too, but that was still the "easy" part of this implementation.
                        The Razor code for the form is shown on the right. The text boxes were the same so I only included one in my list. The first
                        parameter in the textbox one is the name of the variable, the second is null, and the last tells what the box is supposed to do.
                        The patter makes sure that the textbox only accepts Hex values so there are no errors for the C# code.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        Now, when using a HttpPost method you have to include <br>"[HttpPost]" above the name of the function and make sure that the 
                        function includes some parameters so it doesn't crash. (When I first started all it did was crash and I got super confused...) 
                        The logic behind the color chooser was a little harder to do, but once I got that down (with lots of Googling and help from Byte 
                        Club Members) the rest seemed pretty simple. At the time it wasn't, but looking back it all makes sense. I found the blend colors
                        method online, but it makes sense. My algorithm is different from everyone elses because I didn't want to get white every single time.
                        I also don't like to write everything in one function, which is why I used 3. 

                        <br><br>

                        The output of this function creates colored boxes at the bottom of the page. Since there are no query strings
                        I didn't have to test for any bugs (I hope...).This made the testing much easier. There are only 2 possible outputs 
                        for the View. The main page with no colors on it and the page with the colored boxes on them. Screenshots of both can be found
                        below.

                    <h3>Step 5: Merge Branches in Git</h3>
                    <p>
                        So, I created branches (2) and used them, but I guess I forgot
                        to advance Master so the "colorChooser" branch (the one I merged first) 
                        didn't end up showing up so it looks like I just used one branch, but I swear I 
                        didn't. It was intresting to see how the merge conflict showed up because it just 
                        said it couldn't add whatever file it was because of the conflict, when I looked in the file 
                        it just had random lines in places and I got to choose which one to keep. I was impressed.

                        This assignment was fun. It took a little longer than the last one because ASP.NET MVC was
                        something entirely new to me and I worked a lot more this week than last week, but it was good.
                        I definitely feel more comfortable with the MVC framework. I'm sure it'll just keep getting more
                        and more complicated as the weeks go on, but it'll all be okay.
