        <p>
            I am a "senior" at Western Oregon University. It's my third year in college, but if everything goes right
            I will be graduating in the Spring. I am a Computer Science Mathematics Dual Major. I am taking the senior 
            sequence this year and am required to put this up. :)

        <h2>CS 460</h2>
        <p>
            CS 460 is the starting class to the senior sequence. I will be adding all of my homework to this site
            to "show it off." The link can be found <a href="https://interestingliterature.com/2017/04/05/10-of-the-best-short-stories-about-cats/" target="_blank">here</a>.
